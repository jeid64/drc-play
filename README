drc-cap - a passive DRC<->DRH sniffer
=====================================

drc-cap is a toy project that tries to sniff the audio and video data sent from
DRH to DRC and show it on a PC. In practice it works well until a video packet
is missed/lost - when this happens the video stream will be corrupted and there
is no proper way to fix it (DRH streams almost only P-frames).

The code implements a very simple WPA2 sniffer using libpcap to sniff raw
802.11 packets.

This project is not maintained anymore and was nothing more than an experiment.
If someone wants to take it over and try to make it more useful (unlikely this
could happen), patches are welcomed.
