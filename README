drc-cap - a passive DRC<->DRH sniffer
=====================================

drc-cap is a toy project that tries to sniff the audio and video data sent from
DRH to DRC and show it on a PC. In practice it works well until a video packet
is missed/lost - when this happens the video stream will be corrupted and there
is no proper way to fix it (DRH streams almost only P-frames).

The code implements a very simple WPA2 sniffer using libpcap to sniff raw
802.11 packets.
